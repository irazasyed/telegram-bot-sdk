Contributing
============

Contributions are **welcome** and will be fully **credited**.

We accept contributions via Pull Requests on [Github](https://github.com/irazasyed/telegram-bot-sdk). Please review these guidelines before submitting any pull requests.

## Guidelines

- **[PSR-2 Coding Standard](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-2-coding-style-guide.md)** - Follow Standards, [PHP-FIG Naming Conventions](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/bylaws/002-psr-naming-conventions.md). The easiest way to apply the conventions is to install [PHP Code Sniffer](http://pear.php.net/package/PHP_CodeSniffer).

- **Add tests!** - Your patch won't be accepted if it doesn't have tests.

- **Document any change in behaviour** - Make sure the `CHANGELOG.md` and any other relevant documentation are kept up-to-date.

- **Consider our release cycle** - We try to follow [SemVer v2.0.0](http://semver.org/). Randomly breaking public APIs is not an option.

- **Create feature branches** - Don't ask us to pull from your master branch.

- **One pull request per feature** - If you want to do more than one thing, send multiple pull requests.

- **Send coherent history** - Make sure each individual commit in your pull request is meaningful. If you had to make multiple intermediate commits while developing, please [squash them](http://www.git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History#Changing-Multiple-Commit-Messages) before submitting.

- **Rebase** - You may also need to [rebase](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Branching-Rebasing) to avoid merge conflicts.

## Running Tests

``` bash
$ composer test
```

**Happy coding**!
